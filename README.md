This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Development server

Run `jekyll serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `jekyll build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `_site/` directory.
